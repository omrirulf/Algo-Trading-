Returns since each book's start. "Tax paid so far" is the tax due on everything sold or received so far; "if sold today" adds every open position sold at the close. "From the $/₪ move" is the shekel return minus the dollar return, before tax and after tax (if sold today).

The funds are shown after tax once calibration has passed, like every fund result.

## The after-tax gate (section 5c)

No look reached yet. Each look's test is made once, on the first night from the night the race reaches it on which the look is readable, the rate table is there and the funds' prices reach the look's last close.


## For information only (not a gate)

An actively traded fund needs about 0.82 points a year more before tax to tie with VT held 20 years (6% growth, 2% dividend yield). `python -m analysis.tax_breakeven --table`.
