"""Every keyed source the probe proves is a key the cycle receives.

On 18 Sep the first real cycle showed the model a stated blank for the
energy inventories, the price outlook, the crop condition, the rate path
and the earnings record: the four keys were wired into the data-sources
probe and never into the heartbeat, so a runner proved sources the cycle
could not read. This pins the two lists to each other and to the names
orchestrator/sources.py reads first.
